    <h1>Ham Radio Fundamentals</h1>

    <h2>Basic Electronics and Electrical Math</h2>
    <p>In simple terms, electronics may be understood as a branch of science that utilizes and controls the flow of electrons through specially designed networks of active and passive devices to produce a desired result. These networks are basically an interconnection of selected electronic components and constitute an electronic circuit. The electronic components involved are fundamentally classified as active and passive components. Active components play a live role in dimensioning or optimizing the flow of electrons through them as per their design specifications. These are all particularly semiconductor parts which include devices like LEDs, diodes, transistors, ICs, SCRs, triacs and many more, the list may be too long. The passive components are normally made up of carbon or chemical electrolytes and although not able to contribute actively yet play an important part in association with the active devices and complement them in every respect. Without these components, it probably wonâ€™t be feasible to design an electronic circuit. Components like resistors, capacitors, inductors etc. come under the passive electronic components.</p>

    <h2>Basic Radio wave Propagation</h2>
    <p>Radio propagation is the behavior of radio waves as they travel, or are propagated, from one point to another, or into various parts of the atmosphere.</p>
